         <h2>Who am I?</h2>
         <section>
		   <p>My name is Hoda Arbabi and I currently live in the coastal city of Dr√∏bak, Norway. Hodartique is my company that can help you achieve your cultural ambitions.</p>

         <h2>What's it about?</h2>
           <p>My education in theatre in Iran as well as my master in Ibsen studies here in Norway have given me the privilege to better understand and learn about the theatre culture of these two different countries. In addition; some parts of my master thesis was about the influence of Iranian cultural context on performing Ibsen in Iran.</p>

         <h2>Culture and twist</h2>
           <p>Intercultural and interweaving performance is my favorite field in theatre. I did a lot of research about the influence of culture, especially on performance and cinema. Also, I wrote a paper about how Ibsen screened on Iranian cinema.</p>

         <h2>Today</h2>
           <p>Currently, I am a master student of screen culture at the Oslo University since August 2019. Being a novice in media studies, it is fascinating how much I really like this field, after my two first semesters of the study.</p>

         <h2>Thesis</h2>
           <p>My thesis investigates censorship in Iranian cinema from the comparative perspectives of culturally native Iranian spectators and non-Iranian spectators, with a keen interest in the local Norwegian context.</p>
